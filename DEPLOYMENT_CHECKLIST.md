## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Rewards not initializing**
```bash
# Re-run initialization
cd server
npm run init-rewards
```

**Issue: NFTs not minting on blockchain**
```bash
# Check wallet balance
curl -X POST https://rpc-nebulas-testnet.uniultra.xyz \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getBalance",
    "params": ["YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS", "latest"],
    "id": 1
  }'

# Get testnet tokens from faucet if balance is low
```

**Issue: Blockchain connection fails**
- Verify RPC URL is accessible
- Check contract address is correct
- Ensure private key has minting permissions

**Issue: Notifications not showing**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify reward polling is running
- Check API response from `/rewards/:userId`
