# User Campaign Claim Flow - Complete Guide

## Overview
Users can now view active campaigns and claim NFTs if they meet the eligibility requirements. The system automatically checks eligibility before allowing claims.

## How It Works

### 1. View Active Campaigns
**URL**: `/campaigns`

Users see a grid of all active campaigns with:
- Campaign name and description
- Rarity level (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic)
- Progress bar showing claimed/total supply
- Benefits and rewards
- Eligibility status
- Claim button (if eligible)

### 2. Eligibility Checking

The system automatically checks if users meet the requirements:

#### Campaign Types & Requirements:

**Open (No Requirements)**
```
âœ… Everyone can claim
```

**Community-Based**
```
Requirements:
- Must be member of specific community
- Optional: Minimum posts in that community

Example: "Join Book Lovers community and make 5 posts"
```

**Engagement-Based**
```
Requirements:
- Minimum total posts across all communities
- Post with minimum number of likes
- Minimum comments received

Example: "Have 10 total posts and 1 post with 50+ likes"
```

**Reading Streak-Based**
```
Requirements:
- Maintain X consecutive days of reading

Example: "Maintain a 7-day reading streak"
```

**Event-Based**
```
Requirements:
- Must attend specific event

Example: "Attend the Author Meet & Greet event"
```

**Purchase-Based**
```
Requirements:
- Minimum purchase amount

Example: "Purchase $50 worth of books"
Note: Currently returns eligible=true (implementation pending)
```

### 3. Claiming Process

When user clicks "Claim NFT":

1. **Pre-Claim Validation**
   - Check if campaign is still active
   - Check if NFTs are still available
   - Re-verify eligibility
   - Check if user already claimed
   - Verify user has wallet connected

2. **NFT Distribution** (Two Methods)

   **Method A: Pre-Minted (Phygital Campaigns)**
   - Transfer NFT from escrow wallet to user
   - Faster transaction
   - Already on blockchain

   **Method B: On-Demand Minting (Regular Campaigns)**
   - Mint new NFT directly to user's wallet
   - Slightly slower but more flexible

3. **Post-Claim Actions**
   - Create off-chain NFT record in database
   - Update on-chain with blockchain data
   - Increment campaign's claimed counter
   - Show success message with transaction hash

### 4. Success Confirmation

After successful claim:
- âœ… Success message displayed
- ðŸ”— Transaction hash with link to block explorer
- ðŸ“¦ NFT added to user's collection
- ðŸ”„ Campaign progress updated

## API Endpoints Used

### Get Active Campaigns
```http
GET /api/campaigns/active/all
```
Returns all campaigns with status='active'

### Check Eligibility
```http
GET /api/campaigns/:campaignId/check-eligibility/:userId
```
Response:
```json
{
  "eligible": true,
  "reason": "Open to all users"
}
```

### Claim NFT
```http
POST /api/campaign-claims/:campaignId/claim
```
Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Response (Success):
```json
{
  "message": "NFT claimed successfully",
  "claim": { /* claim details */ },
  "nft": { /* NFT details */ },
  "transactionHash": "0x..."
}
```

Response (Error):
```json
{
  "message": "Not eligible for this campaign",
  "reason": "You need a 7-day reading streak. Current: 3 days."
}
```

## User Flow Example

### Scenario: Claiming a Community Campaign

1. **User navigates to /campaigns**
   - Sees "Book Club Rewards" campaign
   - Shows: "ðŸ”’ Not Eligible"
   - Reason: "You must join the required community first"

2. **User joins the community**
   - Navigates to /communities
   - Joins "Book Lovers Club"
   - Makes required number of posts

3. **User returns to /campaigns**
   - Campaign now shows: "ðŸ”“ Community requirements met"
   - "Claim NFT" button is now active

4. **User clicks "Claim NFT"**
   - Confirmation modal appears
   - Shows campaign details and benefits
   - User confirms claim

5. **System processes claim**
   - Shows "Claiming..." spinner
   - Mints/transfers NFT on blockchain
   - Transaction completes

6. **Success!**
   - "ðŸŽ‰ Success!" message
   - Transaction hash displayed
   - Link to view on block explorer
   - NFT appears in user's collection

## Testing the Flow

### Test Case 1: Open Campaign (No Requirements)
```
1. Navigate to /campaigns
2. Find campaign with "Open to all users"
3. Click "Claim NFT"
4. Should succeed immediately
```

### Test Case 2: Community Campaign
```
1. Create campaign with community requirement
2. As user, try to claim â†’ Should fail
3. Join required community
4. Make required posts (if any)
5. Try to claim again â†’ Should succeed
```

### Test Case 3: Already Claimed
```
1. Claim an NFT successfully
2. Refresh page
3. Try to claim same campaign again
4. Should show "You have already claimed this campaign"
```

### Test Case 4: Sold Out Campaign
```
1. Create campaign with small supply (e.g., 2 NFTs)
2. Claim with 2 different users
3. Third user tries to claim
4. Should show "Sold Out"
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

Campaigns track:
- `claimed` - Number of NFTs claimed
- `analytics.completions` - Successful claims
- `analytics.views` - Campaign views
- `analytics.conversionRate` - Claimed/Minted ratio

## Smart Contract Integration

### Pre-Minted Campaigns
Uses: `transferFromEscrow(from, to, tokenId)`
- Faster
- Lower gas per claim
- Limited to 100 NFTs (gas constraints)

### On-Demand Campaigns
Uses: `mintNFT(to, metadata)`
- Flexible
- No pre-mint required
- Unlimited supply possible

## Database Models

### CampaignClaim
```javascript
{
  campaignId: ObjectId,
  userId: String,
  nftId: ObjectId,
  tokenId: String,
  status: 'pending' | 'claimed' | 'transferred' | 'failed',
  transferTransactionHash: String,
  errorMessage: String,
  claimedAt: Date
}
```

### NFT
```javascript
{
  userId: String,
  name: String,
  image: String,
  category: String,
  rarity: String,
  description: String,
  benefits: [String],
  brand: String,
  tokenId: String,
  transactionHash: String,
  blockNumber: Number,
  onChain: Boolean
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow**
   - Create a test campaign
   - Submit for approval (admin)
   - Approve it
   - Pre-mint NFTs (if <100)
   - Activate campaign
   - Claim as user

2. **Verify on blockchain**
   - Check transaction on U2U explorer
   - Verify NFT ownership
   - Confirm metadata

3. **Test eligibility logic**
   - Test each eligibility type
   - Verify error messages
   - Check edge cases

4. **Monitor for issues**
   - Check server logs
   - Monitor blockchain transactions
   - Track claim success rates

## Troubleshooting

**Campaign not appearing in /campaigns?**
- Check campaign status is 'active'
- Verify startDate <= now
- Check endDate > now (if set)

**Eligibility always showing false?**
- Check eligibility service logs
- Verify user data (posts, streaks, etc.)
- Test with 'open' eligibility first

**Claim fails with "Wallet not connected"?**
- User needs to set `walletAddress` in their User document
- Implement wallet connection UI

**Transaction fails?**
- Check wallet has U2U tokens for gas
- Verify smart contract is deployed
- Check blockchain service is initialized

## Success Indicators

âœ… Users can see active campaigns
âœ… Eligibility checking works correctly
âœ… Eligible users can claim NFTs
âœ… Transaction completes on blockchain
âœ… NFT appears in user's collection
